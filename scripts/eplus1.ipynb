    "This notebook was created in order to document the workflow and processes of EnergyPlus within Python. This is for my project involving the parameterization of EnergyPlus. Given that EnergyPlus has over 2000 available inputs, more research needs to be done in order to document which parameters are most significant and relevant in home energy modeling and simulations. \n",
