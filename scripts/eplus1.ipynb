    "This project aims to enhance the accuracy of building energy simulations by sourcing precise local weather data. By leveraging the NCEI (National Centers for Environmental Information) API, we are able to identify and retrieve data from the nearest weather station to any specified location. This localized weather data is crucial for feeding into EnergyPlus simulations, ensuring that our building models operate under realistic environmental conditions. The accurate simulation of energy usage and needs based on actual weather data helps in designing more efficient and sustainable buildings.\n",
