   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Node Connection Errors
   ************* ..Node connection errors are often caused by spelling mistakes in a node name field.
   ************* ..To track down the problem, search the idf file for each node name listed to see if it
   ************* ..occurs in the expected input fields.
   ************* Loads Initialization did not Converge
   ************* ..1) very high thermal mass such as very thick concrete (solution: increase max number of warmup
   ************* ..   days in the BUILDING object);
   ************* ..2) moderate mass and inadequate space conditioning such that the building keeps getting warmer
   ************* ..   and warmer on successive days (solution: add HVAC, check building thermal properties,
   ************* ..   check if infiltration is included, make sure HVAC properly controlled);
   ************* ..3) a soil layer modeled below the concrete slab - (solution remove this layer and read about
   ************* ..   ground temperatures in the Auxiliary Programs document).
   ************* ..4) unreasonable (too small) limits in the BUILDING object for temperature (.4 default) or
   ************* ..   loads tolerances (.04 default)
