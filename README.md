# eplus
Researching the application of EnergyPlus in parallel computing and ensemble research. 

Packages: 

- tempset: allows for varied thermometer setting 
- esoreader: allows for usage of eso in a format
- zeppy: tool for running EnergyPlus in parallel 
- eppy: tool for accessing EnergyPlus API easier. API wrapper. 
- epw: Lightweight Python package for editing EnergyPlus Weather (epw) files
- diyepw: A Python package for Do-It-Yourself EnergyPlus weather file generation
  - Note: This file requires a depreciated version of Python. To use diyepw, I created an entirely new Python environment using Python 3.9.
